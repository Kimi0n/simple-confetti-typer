# Simple Confetti Typer
A text input that shoots confetti whenever you type something. Inspired by the Discord Party Mode.

## Usage
Download the html file and open it in a browser (only tested on Chrome). Confetti will fly for every character you type and your combo will grow. If you stop typing or try to delete/edit your input, your combo will break. Hit enter to save your written text into a text file.
