# simple-confetti-typer
A text input that shoots confetti whenever you type something. Inspired by the Discord Party Mode. It encourages you to type your text without thinking too hard about it or changing anything so you can focus on getting your ideas written down. It is intended to prevent writers' block.

## Usage
Download the html file and open it in a browser (only tested on Chrome). Confetti will fly for every character you type and your combo will grow. If you stop typing or try to delete/edit your input, your combo will break. Hit enter to save your written text into a text file.
